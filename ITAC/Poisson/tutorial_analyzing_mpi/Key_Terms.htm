<h1>Key Terms</h1>

<p>The following terms are used throughout this tutorial:</p>
<p><a name="cpu_time" id="cpu_time"></a><b>CPU time:</b> The amount of time a thread spends executing on a logical processor. For multiple threads, the CPU time of the threads is summed. The application CPU time is the sum of the CPU time of all the threads that run the application.</p>
<p><a name="elapsed_time" id="elapsed_time"></a><b>Elapsed time:</b> The total time your target ran, calculated as follows: Wall clock time at end of application - Wall clock time at start of application.</p>
<p><a name="hotspot" id="hotspot"></a><b>hotspot:</b> A section of code that took a long time to execute. Some hotspots may indicate bottlenecks and can be removed, while other hotspots inevitably take a long time to execute due to their nature.</p>
<p><a name="idealized_tracefile" id="idealized_tracefile"></a><b>idealized trace file:</b> A trace file of the application under ideal circumstances &#160;- infinite bandwidth and zero latency.</p>
<p><a name="serialization" id="serialization"></a><b>serialization:</b> An effect in which a parallel program is reduced to serial execution due to blocking effects between execution units.</p>
<p><a name="target" id="target"></a><b>target:</b> An executable file you analyze using the Intel® VTune™ Amplifier.</p>
