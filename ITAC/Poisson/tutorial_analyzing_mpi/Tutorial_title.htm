<h1 class="firsttitle">Tutorial: Analyzing MPI Applications with Intel® Trace Analyzer and Collector and Intel® VTune™ Amplifier XE</h1>
<p>This tutorial demonstrates a basic workflow of analyzing an MPI application, which you can ultimately apply this workflow to your own applications.</p>
<p>To improve performance of some complex applications, it is necessary to analyze their cross-process behavior as well as their single process performance. Intel® Trace Analyzer and Collector enables you to analyze communications between processes, while Intel® VTune™ Amplifier XE helps you find single process performance issues.</p>
