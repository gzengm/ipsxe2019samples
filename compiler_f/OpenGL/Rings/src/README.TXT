Rings example for Intel Visual Fortran

This program demonstrates the use of OpenGL transforms. It draws five colored rings
in the display window, each with a random position and orientation.  It then gradually
rotates and moves the rings towards their final configuration.

When the user presses the space bar, a new set of rings is displayed, with a different
random position and orientation, and these move towards the final configuration.  Each
time the space bar is pressed, the rate at which the rings rotate and move is randomized,
so that each display is different.
